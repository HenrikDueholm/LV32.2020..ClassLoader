# LV32.2020..ClassLoader
Easy support for dynamic loading of classes stored in PPLs
Project still in initial stage. So far the following has been implemented:
- Scan PPL folder for all classes. The PPL folder is the folder where the PPL built from this project resides, all PPLs are assumed to be placed in the same folder.
- Load any class from the PPL folder by name or qualified name
